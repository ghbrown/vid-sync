# Vid Sync
## A Simple YouTube Multi-Video Playback Syncing Tool

This projects provides a wonky solution to a niche problem. The website [ViewSync](https://viewsync.net) allows users to watch multiple youtube videos at the same time while allowing setting a time offset for each video. This is great for watching different POVs of an event. 

We present a solution that (kind of) eliminates the need for manual alignment. We use audio data to obtain a set of time offsets of given YouTube urls and generates a link to open [ViewSync](https://viewsync.net) player directly.

### Algorithm
Our algorithm compares all unique pairs of signal extracted from the audio file to maximize their correlation. First the two signals are appended by silence to allow for all possible lag configurations. To theses padded signals we then apply the Fourier transform which allows us to access the frequency domain of the signals which naturally encodes information of the signals. 
$X[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{-i \frac{2 \pi}{N} k n}$
In the frequency domain we then compute the correlation of the two signals
$\sum X[k]Y^*[k]$
and apply the inverse fourier transform
$x[n] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X[k] e^{i \frac{2 \pi}{N} k n}$

This correlation function is then maximized to compute the temporal offset that maximizes allignment and coherence of the signals. This computation is performed and the computed optimal lags are added up. Finally we set the minimal lag needed for synchronization to 0, keeping the relative lags equal.

### Example Video Sets
Here are a couple sets of YouTube videos that can be synchronized by our application. Simply copy the links one by one in each group into our website, and click "Kick off sync". After a while, once the loading animation disappears, you will be presented with a link and a button that takes you to the [ViewSync](https://viewsync.net) website. Just follow the instructions there to enjoy different POVs of the same event all at once.
