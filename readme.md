# Vid Sync
## A simple YouTube multi-video playback syncing tool

This projects provides a wonky solution to a niche problem. The website [ViewSync]{https://viewsync.net} allows users to watch multiple youtube videos at the same time while allowing setting a time offset for each video. This is great for watching different POVs of an event. 

We present a solution that (kind of) eliminates the need for manual alignment. We use audio data to obtain a set of time offsets of given YouTube urls and generates a link to open [ViewSync]{https://viewsync.net} player directly.
